#### dev-master
 * Catch 2 possible exceptions when something goes wrong generating a cache key
 * Reformat & Refactor to new Inpsyde Standard (Breaking change: Methods are now CamelCased!)
 * Allow to `json_encode` the`WP_STASH_DRIVER_ARGS` instead of serializing them
 * Implement `cache_hits` and `cache_misses`  so tools like Query Monitor work with it.

#### 1.0.0
 * Initial Release
